<h3 class='helptitle ui-widget-header ui-corner-all'>Brief description:</h3>
The log viewer displays the 50 most recent log messages generated by the rig 
client ordered by the most recent logs first. A color scheme is used to
identify logs from a specific log level (provided the log level is contained
in the log message string).

<h3 class='helptitle ui-widget-header ui-corner-all'>Log levels:</h3>
The rig client uses the following log levels:
<ul>
	<li><span class='bold code'>FATAL</span> - Messages that are generated by 
	events that cause unexpected program termination.</li>
	<li><span class='bold code'>PRIORITY</span> - Messages that are not errors
	but should always be printed.</li>
	<li><span class='bold code'>ERROR</span> - Messages that are generated by
	events that cause unexpected results and stop program execution sequence.
	</li>
	<li><span class='bold code'>WARN</span> - Messages that are generated by 
	events that cause undesired results but do not stop the expected program
	execution sequence.
	<div class='ui-state ui-state-highlight ui-corner-all helphint'>
		<span class='ui-icon ui-icon-info helphinticon'> </span>
		<span class='bold'>HINT:</span> <span class='code'>'WARN'</span>
		is the most appropriate level during normal operation of the rig 
		client as it prints messages that should be attended to and is not 
		overly verbose.
	</div>
	</li>
	<li><span class='bold code'>INFO</span> - Messages that are generated by
	events that are regular in occurrence and highlight the progress of the 
	rig client at a coarse-grained level.</li>
	<li><span class='bold code'>DEBUG</span> - Messages specifying program
	fine-grained execution and progression and are useful to debug rig client
	errors.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class='helptitle ui-widget-header ui-corner-all'>Log types:</h3>
The log type specifies where logs are persisted to. The rig client can
be configured with the following logs:
<ul>
	<li><span class='bold code'>RolledFile</span> - Saves log messages
	to a configured text file. The text file is 'rolled' when it reaches
	a configured size to stop file system bloat.
	<div class='ui-state ui-state-highlight ui-corner-all helphint'>
		<span class='ui-icon ui-icon-info helphinticon'> </span>
		<span class='bold'>HINT:</span> <span class='code'>'RolledFile'</span>
		is usually the most appropriate log type during normal operation of the
		rig client as the log messages are easy to transport for offline 
		anaylsis. Also, most support requests to the Sahara developers require
		logs as	a pre-requiste for providing help.  
	</div>
	</li>
	<li><span class='bold code'>File</span> - Saves log messages
	to a configured text file. The log file is not 'rolled' and left
	unchecked is susceptible to bloating the file system.</li>
	<li><span class='bold code'>Syslog</span> - Provides the log messages to
	a <em>'syslog'</em> server. This log type is only appropriate to UNIX
	operating systems.</li>
	<li><span class='bold code'>WinEvents</span> - Provides the log messages
	to host operating systems <em>Windows Event Log</em>. These may be viewed
	by opening 'Control Panel' -&gt; ''Administrative Tools' -&gt; 'Event 
	Viewer'. This log type is only appropriate to Windows operating systems.
	<div class='ui-state ui-state-error ui-corner-all helphint'>
		<span class='ui-icon ui-icon-alert helphinticon'> </span>
		<span class='bold'>NOTE:</span> Before the <span class='code'>WinEvents
		</span> log type can be used the file <span class='code bold'>
		NTEventLogAppender.dll</span> file must be placed in the rig client's 
		library path. Otherwise this log type will fail with a <span class='code'>
		UnsatisfiedLinkError</span>.
	</div>
	</li>
	<li><span class='bold code'>SystemErr</span> - Prints the log messagse to the
	standard error stream of the rig client process. With this log type log 
	messages are not persisted but are lost after they are printed.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class='helptitle ui-widget-header ui-corner-all'>Log format:</h3>
The log format dictates what is displayed as a log message and can be configured
system wide or on a per log level basis. The configuration involves using 
'macro' strings which are place holders to be replaced by the run time value.
<ul>
	<li><span class='bold code'>__MESSAGE__</span> - Actual log message.</li>
	<li><span class='bold code'>__LEVEL__</span> - Level the message was logged
	at (i.e. ERROR, WARN, ...).</li>
	<li><span class='bold code'>__TIME__</span> - Message generation time with 
	hour of day:minute:second.</li>
	<li><span class='bold code'>__DATE__</span> - Message generation date with
	day:minute:year.</li>
	<li><span class='bold code'>__ISO8601__</span> - Message generation 
	timestamp in the ISO8601 format.</li>
	<li><span class='bold code'>__CLASS__</span> - Class where the message
	orginated.</li>
	<li><span class='bold code'>__METHOD__</span> - Method where the message
	orginated.</li>
	<li><span class='bold code'>__SOURCE__</span> - Source file where the
	message orginated.</li>
	<li><span class='bold code'>__LINE_NUM__</span> - Line number where the 
	message orginated.</li>
	<li><span class='bold code'>__TID__</span> - Thread id which executed the
	instruction to log the message.</li>
</ul>
