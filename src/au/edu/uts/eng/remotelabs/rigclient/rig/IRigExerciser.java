/**
 * Interface for rig exerciser / monitoring operations. The exerciser is a
 * rig <strong>watch-dog</strong> to ensure the rig is within operational
 * tolerance. Exercisers are built chaining together multiple exerciser
 * tests and should test the following rig attributes:
 * 
 * <ul>
 *    <li>Existence (network, device nodes) - can the device be contacted.</li>
 *    <li>Environment (power, air pressure) - does the current environment
 *              support the operating needs of the rig.</li>
 *    <li>Hardware (pistons, actuators, solenoids, motors) - can be the hardware
 *              be commanded to be perform its desired actions.</li>
 *    <li>Sensor (LVDS, magnetostrictive, temperature, time) - does a movement 
 *              of the hardware generate the desired measurable results
 *              within a tolerance of the expected results.</li>
 * </ul>
 *  
 * The <code>setInterval</code> method provides an indication of how often the
 * test should run and the test implementor has discretion to either honour
 * or ignore the test interval. It is suggested, tests which provide a noticeable
 * affect or yield the rig should run at the test interval period, tests which
 * do not, should run often to detect errors and problems at the earliest
 * possible time.
