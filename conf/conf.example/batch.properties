###############################################################################
#
# Instruction file sanity checks ensure the uploaded instruction is
# applicable to what the batch process may run. The configured batch runner
# contains three such file sanity tests which may be run:
#
#     * File extension - if the uploaded file extension matches the configured
#               file extension
#     * File magic number - if the uploaded file magic number (a value in up to
#               the first eight bytes) matches the configured magic number.
#     * File maximum size - if the uploaded file size is less than the
#               configured maximum file size.
#

# Whether to test the instruction file extension. If this is set to true,
# File_Extension property must be set. The default value is false to specify
# not to test a file extension.
# Batch_Test_File_Extension [true|false]
# Batch_Test_File_Extension true

# Instruction file extension. Should be configured as a string specifying the
# characters of the file extension. The file extension test will check if the
# instruction file name ends with the configured extension.
# Batch_File_Extension <String>
# Batch_File_Extension tar.gz
Batch_File_Extension .tar.gz

# Whether to test for instruction file maximum size. If this is set to true,
# the File_Size property must be set with the maximum permissible instruction
# file size. The default value is false to specify not to test for file
# size.
# Batch_Test_Max_File_Size [true|false]
# Batch_Test_Max_File_Size true
Batch_Test_Max_File_Size true

# Maximum file size of the instruction file in kilobytes.
# Max_File_Size <int>
# Max_File_Size 1024
Batch_Max_File_Size 1024

# Whether to test the instruction file for magic number. Many files have constants
# that identify the contained data. Detecting such constants in files is an effective
# way of distinguishing between many file formats. If this is set top true, the
# File_Magic_Number property must be set with a hexadecimal representation of the
# file magic number. The default value is false to specify not to test for file
# magic number.
# Batch_Test_Magic_Number [true|false]
# Batch_Test_Magic_Number true
Batch_Test_Magic_Number true

# File magic number in hexadecimal format. The prefix '0x' is optional.
