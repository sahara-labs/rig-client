# The logging subsystem which specifies where logs are persisted to. The
# following logging types are implemented:
#
#    * SystemErr - logs messages to the process standard error stream;
#    * File - logs messages to a plain text file and is susceptible to
#             log file bloat;
#    * RolledFile - logs messages to a plain text file and is rolled
#                   when it reaches a configured size;
#    * Syslog - logs messages to a Syslog server;
#    * WinEvents - logs messages to the Windows Event Log.
#
# NOTE: The WinEvents logger only runs on Windows and requires the file
# 'NTEventLogAppender.dll' to placed in PATH.
# Logger_Type [SystemErr | File | RolledFile | Syslog | WinEvents]
# Logger_Type RolledFile
Logger_Type SystemErr

# The level of log messages that are logged. Configuring a more verbose log
# level will print that log levels messages and the preceding less verbose
# log levels. The log levels that may be configured  in order of least
# verbosity are:
#
#    * ERROR - Messages that are generated by events that cause unexpected \
#              results and stop the expected program execution sequence.
#    * WARN - Messages that are generated by events that cause undesired \
#             results but do not stop the expected program execution sequence.
#    * INFO - Messages that are generated by events that are regular in \
#             occurrence, however are useful for audit trails.
#    * DEBUG - Messages specifying program execution and progression.
# Log_Level [ERROR | WARN | INFO | DEBUG]
