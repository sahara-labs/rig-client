# Rig Client core configuration file. Format of each item is:                 #
#     # <Description> A description of the configuration item.                #
#     # <Name> <Type> Configuration key - Configuration value type            #
#     # <Example> Provided example of correct configuration                   #
#     Key <Value> Actual configuration                                        #
#                                                                             #
# NOTE: Key values and enumerated values ARE case sensitive.                  #
# Also NOTE: The rig client is not very defensive for valid configuration so  #
# if the expected configuration value type is specified as an int or integer  #
# and you don't put a valid integer as the value, tough, the rig client will  #
# most likely crash. You have been warned!                                    #
