# The Linux device node test checks if a device node exists and has the desired

# the device node '/dev/video0' is a character device node with major and minor
# numbers (identifies the driver) that correspond to the 'video4linux' driver
# which interfaces with the hardware. At its most basic the device node test
# ensures a file exists in the file system and may optionally test file 
# attributes (type and permissions) and device node attributes (major and minor
# numbers). The driver test checks for the '/proc/devices' file and ensures the
# the device driver has the same major number as the device node.
#
# One to many device node files may be configured by sequencing the
# LinuxDeviceNode_Test_Path_<n> with a suffix number from 1 to n. The attributes
# to test of the device node may be set by suffixing the test property with the
# same number as the LinuxDeviceNode_Test_Path_<n> property.
#
# NOTE: The Linux device node test will only run on Linux. Running it on any 
# other platform will cause an error to be raised.

# List of camera details from 1 to number of cameras specified in Number_of_Cameras.
# These camera details provide information about how to generate the camera stream
# URL as given by the 'FORMAT' portion of the configuration string.
# On the web interface side, in the 'config.ini' file, there should be properties named
# 'camera.<format>' containing the video stream URL template.
# To generate the stream URL, variables within chevrons ('<', '>') are replaced
# with the corresponding value in the configuration string specified in 'config.ini'
# Multiple formats can be listed, seperating each with a comma.
#
# For example, the configuration string:
# HOST=shakermonitor1.eng.uts.edu.au,PORT=7070,NUM=2,SIZE=320x240,FORMAT=jpeg;mms;mmsh
#
# With web interface configuration:
# camera.jpeg = http://<HOST>:<PORT>/stream<NUM>.jpg
# camera.mms = mms://<HOST>:<PORT>/stream<NUM>_v_medium.asf
# camera.mmsh = mmsh://<HOST>:<PORT>/stream<NUM>_v_medium.asf
#
# Generates the stream URLs:
# http://127.0.0.1:7070/stream2.jpg
# mms://127.0.0.1:7070/stream2_v_medium.asf
# mmsh://127.0.0.1:7070/stream2_v_medium.asf
#
# Each format specified in the 'config.ini' file is listed in the camera panel of the rig
# interface as an option to select. Known  formats (listed below) are deployed using a
# predetermined browser plugin client. Unknown formats are deployed with a
# detected plugin that *should* display the stream. Known formats:
#   * jpeg - JPEG frames deployed with a slider to select the refresh period
#            (between 250ms and 2s).
#   * mms  - Microsoft Media Server stream deployed using Window Media Player
#            plugin.
#   * mmsh - MMS over HTTP deployed using the VideoLAN plugin.
#
# Some common portions of a camera configuration string are:
#   * FORMAT - Specifies the streaming option(s). This is mandatory portion.
#   * SIZE   - The size of video frames in the format '<width>x<height>'.
#   * HOST   - The host name or IP address of the camera server.
#   * PORT   - The port number of the streaming server is listening on.
#   * TITLE  - The camera panel title.
